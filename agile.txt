Theme:
Get GiggleGit demo into a stable enough alpha to start onboarding some adventurous clients

Epic:
Onboarding experience

User Story 1:
As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to understand how merges are managed by memes and explore how this differs from vanilla Git, so I can evaluate whether to adopt GiggleGit.

Task 1:
Create onboarding documentation for git power-users

Ticket 1:
Title: Write onboarding guide for vanilla Git users
Details: Develop a step-by-step onboarding guide that explains the differences between GiggleGit and vanilla Git. Highlight how to perform basic operations and how memes are integrated into the merge process.

Ticket 2:
Title: Create a comparison chart between GiggleGit and vanilla Git
Details: Create a visual comparison chart that outlines key differences and similarities between vanilla Git and GiggleGit for experienced users.

User Story 2:
As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to set up best practices for my teamâ€™s repository and meme management, so that I can ensure consistency and efficiency during merges.

Task 1:
Define team onboarding best practices

Details: Design a process for teams to share and approve memes used in the merging process, ensuring memes are appropriate and aligned with team culture.

User Story 3:
As a developer using GiggleGit for the first time, I want to test out meme-based merges in a safe environment without impacting live repositories, so I can learn how to effectively use this feature without risk.

Task 1:
Provide a sandbox environment for meme merges

Ticket 1:
Title: Implement a sandbox environment for testing meme-based merges
Details: Set up a sandbox feature where users can perform mock merges with memes without affecting real code repositories.

Ticket 2:
Title: Create example scenarios for practicing meme merges
Details: Develop a series of example merge conflicts and walk users through resolving them with memes in the sandbox environment.
