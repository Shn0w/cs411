Goal:
Ensure a seamless user experience when syncing changes using SnickerSync, with clear visual and audio cues aligned to the "sync with a snicker" concept.

Non-Goal:
Do not implement automated resolution of merge conflicts based on snickering concepts; focus on the user-driven merge process and experience instead.

Non-Functional Requirement 1: Access Control
PMs should be able to maintain and modify the snickering concepts without needing developer intervention.
Functional Requirement 1.1:
Implement an admin interface for PMs that allows them to update, delete, or add new snickering concepts via a user-friendly UI.

Functional Requirement 1.2:
Ensure that only authorized PMs can access the admin interface through role-based authentication, with permissions restricted to updating snickering concepts.

Non-Functional Requirement 2: Randomized User Studies
User studies must allow random assignment of participants between control and variant groups for testing the effectiveness of different snickering features.
Functional Requirement 2.1:
Create a randomized user assignment system that divides users evenly between control and variant groups during user studies, ensuring unbiased distribution.

Functional Requirement 2.2:
Design a user study dashboard where the PMs can track and manage the progress of the study, monitor user assignments, and view aggregated results from both control and variant groups.

These requirements ensure SnickerSync functions efficiently while maintaining flexibility and control for PMs, all while enabling the execution of randomized user studies to measure feature effectiveness.
